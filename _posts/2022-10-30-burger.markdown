description: This hamburger was inspired by Bob's Burgers and was made for a group Halloween costume. Constructed primarily of high density foam and cloth this burger is light weight and easy on the shoulders. In addition to looking great and (probably) tasting terrible, this costume can be worn on any occasion! At the office or on the streets this delightful stack of discs is sure to be a hit!<br><br><a href="http://www.instructables.com/DIY-Hamburger-Costume/" >Instructables 2022 Halloween Contest Runner Up</a>
