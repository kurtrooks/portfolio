description: As a geek, I like to know my bandwidth usage when I'm gaming/streaming/bored (okay, all the time!). This bandwidth meter sits between a router and cable modem, and provides a realtime visualization of the current network useage. The LED matrix display is driven by a custom PCB which interfaces with the MAC/PHY hardware to get second by second accurate data.<br><br> This project was featured <a href="https://hackaday.com/2013/12/15/build-an-in-line-network-bandwidth-monitor/">Hackaday</a>!
