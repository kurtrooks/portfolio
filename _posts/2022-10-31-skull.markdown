description: This ram skull was 3D printed in eight pieces using two FDM printers and a scaled up version of a publicly available <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:473590">3D model</a>. The assembled pieces were then painted and weathered to create a more lifelike prop. <br><br><img src="img/portfolio/skull_pieces.jpg" width="500"/>
