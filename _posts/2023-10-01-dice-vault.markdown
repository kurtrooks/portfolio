description: Become the envy of game night with this eye catching magnetic dice vault. The vault doubles as a display allowing you to gaze upon your tools of trade while doing battle with your foe of choice. Made from solid walnut and maple wood this vault not only looks good, but can also take a beating (probably). It features cut outs for a set of seven die (D20, D12, 2x D10, D8, D6, D4), but could easily be adapted to meet your specific needs. The walnut end caps are held in place with strong neodymium magnets that secure the vault close for storage and keep the two halves aligned when in use.
